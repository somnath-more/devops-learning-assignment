## Why there is need of package json

- define script so that we can execute using npm package
- Dependency Management:
  The package.json file contains information about the project's dependencies, including the specific versions required.

## Why there is need of tsconfig.json

A tsconfig.json file is necessary for projects that use TypeScript, as it contains information about the project's compilation options, including the source code's compiler version, the target JavaScript version, and the location of any third-party libraries or modules that the project depends on.

## Use of WebPack

Module Bundling:

Webpack allows you to organize your JavaScript code into modules and then bundles these modules together into a single or multiple optimized files. This helps in reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving the loading time of your web application.

- Asset Loading:

Webpack supports the loading of various assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets. It can handle different types of assets and optimize them for production, ensuring efficient loading and rendering of your web pages.
## Transpilation:

Webpack can be configured to work seamlessly with transpilers like Babel. This enables you to write code using the latest ECMAScript features and have it automatically transpile to an older version of JavaScript that is compatible with a broader range of browsers.

Webpack is a versatile tool that plays a crucial role in modern web development, addressing the challenges associated with managing complex JavaScript applications and optimizing the performance of web pages.
